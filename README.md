## 1st Lecture: Introduction to EEG-dependent BCIs

During the first lecture on Brain Computer Interfaces, held on 12/12/2022, we introduce some basic definitions, principles of EEG signals acquisition up to analyzing a first dataset (available in [BCIIV_calib_ds1a.mat](...)) and understanding its main features.
Matlab code to open this dataset in Matlab and Matlab file we used to preprocess them are respectively [Open_dataset.m]() and [Pre_process_data.m](). Then we analyzed the data following the steps in [L_1.ipynb]()
In [Lezione_1_BCI_MLJC .pptx]() we share the slides of the first theorethical part while in [BCIcompIV_dataset_description.pdf] the description of the experimental protocol and subjects characteristics are available.
