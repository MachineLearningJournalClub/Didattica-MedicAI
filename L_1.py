# Signals handling
General processing utilities can be found in packages like [SciPy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/index.html), which manipulates signals in form of NumPy arrays, but some libraries exist for specific applications such as neuroimaging signals applications: an example is [MNE](https://mne.tools/stable/python_reference.html). 

MNE manipulates signals as objects, not as simple arrays: this makes it a little more tricky to set your dataset up, but helps a lot when it's time to plot and process data.

"""Usually EEG signals have to be filtered to remove slow drifts (low frequencies components) and power line interference noise (50 Hz in Europe, 60 Hz in USA), and finally to isolate the informative content of the signal (usually not more than 45 Hz, due to the low-pass behaviour of scalp anf tissues that the signal has to pass through).

To reach these objectives, the common solution is to use an high-pass filter (HPF) with cut-off frequency (fc) at 0.5 Hz, a band-stop filter, aka *notch filter*, centered at the power-line frequency, and a low-pass filter (LPF) with fc=40 Hz. (yep, if we cut this low with the LPF, the notch is not necessary, but just for you to know, with any other signal, if your interested in higher frequencies, don't ever forget to cut off the power-line noise)  

As we can see from the dataset docs, this signal is already filtered between .5 and 49 Hz, so filtering with the objective of cleaning the signals up is not necessary. But we can use a band-pass filter (BPF) also to isolate some frequency components and visualize them in time, or compute their power without wasting time on all the others.

Let's assume we want to plot the alpha component (8-13 Hz) in time domain, thats how we do it.

Usually EEG data (to be used as part of a training dataset) is acquired in the context of an experimental protocol, consisting of visual/auditory cues which can trigger event related potentials (ERP) or tell the subject when to start with the endogenous oscillatory process (such as in motor imagery protocols).

We can use this cues to epoch the signal and extract specific features related to the mental state of the subject around those particular time points.

In this dataset we have two motor imagery (MI) classes and then two different cues associated to two different labels: -1 and 1. 

To obtain an Epochs object we need some ingredients:
- the Raw object containing EEG data, `thisRec`
- an array containing the labels fro each time stamp, `stim_data`

These ingredients must be manipulated first to get a Raw object complete of a *stimuli* channel, second to get the events array from it, third to finally obtain the Epochs object.
